# landing-page

The main objective of this landing page is to practice my skills and knowledge of using Flexbox along with HTML and CSS. In order to move on to the Javascript portion of the Foundations course in The Odin Project, I must complete this project, and in doing so, begin the process of building my web development portfolio online. 

As I continue with the foundational web development course, I expect to update and improve on this landing page and and other pages with links.
